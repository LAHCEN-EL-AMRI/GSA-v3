# GSA v3 - Gamma Spectra Analysis (version 3)
 
The new version of the **GSA v3** software is now available, an advanced and flexible tool dedicated to gamma spectrum analysis. This version introduces numerous enhanced features, enabling users to optimize peak identification and adjustment, manage regions of interest (ROI), and efficiently handle background and overlapping peaks. With an intuitive interface and interactive graphical tools, GSA v3 allows both manual and automatic adjustments with high precision, displaying results in real time for complete control over the analysis.
The software is designed to meet the needs of researchers, technicians, and students in gamma spectrometry, combining flexibility, speed, and reliability. It not only allows detailed visualization and manipulation of spectra but also generates clear and structured reports, facilitating documentation and result sharing. This guide aims to present all available features, explain their practical use, and provide guidance for making the most of GSA v3 in conducting precise and professional gamma spectrum analyses.


GSA v3 is free software for non-commercial use only.
